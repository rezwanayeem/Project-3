# Project-3 > CarMate

Motivation:

Whenever we think of costs related to owning a car, we only think about the major costs (i.e. monthly payments, insurance) but often forget to track the hidden costs (i.e. gas, repairs, tire change/rotation, annual registration, quarterly oil changes). This app is designed to catch all the major and hidden costs associated with owing and managing a car. By providing a dedicated platform to catch all the costs this app allows a user to learn more about the financial responsibilities that comes with a car and to better plan for it.

Technology Stack:
1. MongoDB
2. Express

Additional:

Link up to the Kelly Blue Book (KBB) website to obtain the market value and to the financial institution to obtain the remaining pay off balance to calculate the margin a user should consider when there is a need to sell the car
